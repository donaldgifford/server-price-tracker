Read docs/impl/metrics-limit.md and work through the phases sequentially. For each task: 1) Use the appropriate go-development skill and agents (go-architect before new modules, go-review after completing tasks, go-test when writing tests, go-performance at checkpoints noted in the quality gates). 2) Write idiomatic Go — use the uber-go-style-guide for this. 3) Run 'make lint' and 'make fmt' after each task to verify. 4) Check off completed tasks in docs/impl/metrics-limit.md. After each task is complete, update your CLAUDE.md with any necessary updates. 5) Commit after completing each numbered task with conventional commits. Start at the first unchecked task and continue from where you left off. If a phase's acceptance criteria are all met, move to the next phase. Output <promise>MVP COMPLETE</promise> when all phases are done and all acceptance criteria pass.
